# Weather Station ESP8266

# Overview
The repository includes everything needed to build an Weather Station ESP8266 (including hardware information, PCB Design, and footprint):

# What do I Need To Make One?
In this project, we assume that we still need to debug and see the output in serial monitor. So we need :
- Arduino IDE (recommended the lastest version) with serial monitor in PC or Laptop
Other Essential Things :
- Standar USB to Micro USB cable
- ESP-12E Development Board ESP8266 NodeMCU
- OLED I2C Display 128x64 Pixel
- MicroSD Module ([Pict](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wirahitaputramas/Weather-Station-ESP8266-PT-INTI-Internship/master/images/MicroSD%20Modul.jpg "MicroSD Module"))

# How to Make One ?

## 1. Prototype design on breadboard (Fritzing)

## 2. Testing each component separately

## 3. Hookup prototype on breadboard

## 4. Coding The Whole System

## 5. Testing whole prototype on breadboard

## 6. PCB design (KiCad)

## 7. Hookup & Run on PCB
